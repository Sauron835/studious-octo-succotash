<p>One of the first real memorable moments for me in Limbo is getting captured by the spider.</p>

<p>This is the first real stage in the game that I had something to truly fear in the game. Up until this point, the most the game has done has given me a sense of anxiety.
As Frued says "'Fright','fear' and anxiety are improperly used as synonymous expressions; they are in fact capable of clear distinction in their relation to danger.
'Anxiety' describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one. 'Fear' requires a definite object of which to be afraid."
While you do meet the spider earlier when you use the bear traps on its legs, it never really gave me a true sense of fear. 
I was wary of it, but I did not fear it because I had control of what happened between me and it, in this case baiting it into catching its own legs in bear traps. 
It was only during the cave scene where the spider is wrapping you up that I started to fear it, as I no longer had control over the situation.
To comment on it  bit more, it is like the reverse of Frued's observation of the Fort/Da game. "At the outset he was in a passive situation-he was overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unplcasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an active part."
I started out having an active in the game with the spider, however, during the events where you get wrapped in web, you take on the passive role, which leads to a less agreeable but memorable experience.
