<p>I believe Limbo uses anxiety and fear to control how you play and experience the game.</p>

<p>The spider capturing you in its web is the first real stage in the game that I had something to truly fear in the game. Up until this point, the most the game has done has given me a sense of anxiety.
As Frued says "'Fright', 'fear' and anxiety are improperly used as synonymous expressions; they are in fact capable of clear distinction in their relation to danger.
'Anxiety' describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one. 'Fear' requires a definite object of which to be afraid.<font color="green">Freud Beyond the Pleasure Principle 12"</font>

While you do meet the spider earlier when you use the bear traps on its legs, it never really gave me a true sense of fear. 
I was wary of it, but I did not fear it because I had control of what happened between me and it, in this case baiting it into catching its own legs in bear traps. 
It was only during the cave scene where the spider is wrapping you up that I started to fear it, as I no longer had control over the situation.
To comment on it  bit more, it is like the reverse of Frued's observation of the Fort/Da game. "At the outset he was in a passive situation-he was overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unplcasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an active part.<font color="green">(Freud Beyond the Pleasure Principle 16)"</font>
You start out having an active in the game with the spider, however, during the events where you get wrapped in web, you take on the passive role, which leads to a less agreeable but memorable experience.

From this point to the moment you manage to kill the spider, the game uses this fear that has been created as a driving force. The spider will constantly chase you throughput multiple stages and does not seem to give up even when it loses multiple legs. By consistently using the same sounds and visual effects each time the spider appears, the game gives you a subtle hail so you know that the spider is around.<font color="green"> Althusser, L.

Here is a clip of the spider chasing you and catching you right before a lake.

<p> In this clip you can hear an almost droning noise and what seems to be an odd pulsing effect coming from the spider. This is the hail, so even if you do not see the spider immeadiatly, you will still here it coming and know to start moving. Here it is again without the video.</p>

<p>The pulsing noise coming from the spider earlier is most likely its hearthbeat. This thought is from the fact that it stops only once it dies, and that it has a very consistent beat when you see it visually.</p>

<p>While hard to see, there are small yellow peaks that happen conisitently at the bottem of the image. These peaks are what I believe to be the odd pulsing "heartbeat" noise of the spider. Assuming these noises are diagetic, these sounds and noises together create the spider's sound envelope, which is is designed to help push along the fear the spider is desinged to give the player.<font color="green">Didier Anzieu and Segal, N.

But is not only the spider that the game uses as a method of using fear to control the players movement. For instance, the brain leeches in the caves. You first notice the victims of these creatures lying in a pool dead. Then you see a person who has been taken over by one and how he acts. Then finally, you see the leech-like creature itself.

Since you have already seen the effects of what the creature does, unlike the spder, you immeadiatly know to fear it. In fact, the leech is another example of the player having to take on a passive role, as you lose control of your mopvement under its effects. This greatly enhances the fear it can cause. While eventually you have to travel under the leech and be caught, it slowed me down significantly and I spent a lot of time trying to find a way around it.</p>
